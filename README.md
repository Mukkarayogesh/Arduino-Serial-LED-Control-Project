# Arduino-Serial-LED-Control-Project
This project demonstrates real-time control of three LEDs using Arduino serial communication. Text commands like “LED1 ON” or “LED1 OFF” are sent through the serial monitor to control LEDs instantly. This logic is widely used in home automation, Bluetooth control, and IoT-based real-time systems.
